    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly</strong>,
        then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend
        </li>

        <li>
        Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
        for code behaving correctly.
        <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</em></strong> what is this?
        </li>

        <li>
        Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at
        an example:
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
